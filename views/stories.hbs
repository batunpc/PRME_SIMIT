                  “Many farms lack the knowledge, resources, or motivation to
                  become 100% certified organic. Our belief is that the future
                  of cotton, and the industry as a whole, rests on its ability
                  to mobilize and lead the way in agriculture and
                  sustainability. For this reason, we’ve embarked on a project
                  to ensure 100% of our natural fibres are certified organic
                  within the next five years. However, instead of simply
                  neglecting the farms that don’t already have these practices
                  in place, we’ll be working with each farm to set up these
                  systems, so they too can participate in a more sustainable
                  future.”

              Kotn is a Toronto based clothing business that is helping their
              Egyptian cotton supplier to make the switch to organic and
              sustainable within the next five years. Such statements on their
              website shows great promise that it is possible for businesses
              to take the right approach and with the right mindset it is
              possible to become sustainable within a realistic timeframe.
              Kotn also directly sources from the farms to produce their
              products in a process known as direct trade cutting the
              middlemen out.

              They are educating and empowering the farm to become independent
              and sustainable. Imagine the possibilities if more such
              businesses and producers found each other and took the right
              initiatives?
